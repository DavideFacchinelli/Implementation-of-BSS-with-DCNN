In this repository you can find my implementation in keras, with some variances, of a deep convolutional neural network for audio blind source separation as designed by Pritish Chandna, Marius Miron, Jordi Janer and Emilia GÃ³mez in their article "Monoaural Audio Source Separation Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks".

The dataset used for train and test can be found at https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/dsd100.html and is not included in this repository as too heavy.

The repository contains a jupyter-notebook file contaning the implementation and explications, and two .h5 file contaning two sets of pretrained weights, as explained in the notebook.

A better visualization can be seen using nbviewer at the following adress: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DavideFacchinelli/Implementation-of-BSS-with-DCNN/blob/master/implementation.ipynb
